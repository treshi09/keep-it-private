#Write a program to create a class Point that consists of a constructor to set coordinates equal to x and y. Also, it consists of a function that returns the coordinates in Point format. Create an object passing the coordinates and print the Point.

class Point:
    def __init__(self,x=0,y=0):
       self.x = x
       self.y = y
    def getPoint(self):
        print("Point(",self.x,",",self.y,")")
obj = Point() 
obj.getPoint()
